# SRD-YOLOv5: Efficient Multi-Scale UAV Object Detection

The code will be released after paper acceptance.

##  Overview

**SRD-YOLOv5** is a lightweight and high-performance object detection framework, designed for robust and efficient detection of small objects in UAV remote sensing images. Based on YOLOv5n, our method introduces a novel multi-scale feature fusion strategy to tackle scale variations and preserve fine-grained target details in complex aerial scenes.

> **Key Highlights:**
>
> * **Multi-scale Feature Fusion:** Enhanced with MSFE and SSFF modules for rich context aggregation.
> * **Extremely Small Target Detection:** Dedicated high-res detection head for micro-scale objects.
> * **Decoupled Head:** Separate classification/regression for reduced conflict and better localization.
> * **Superior Results:** State-of-the-art accuracy and speed on VisDrone2019, RSOD, and NWPU VHR-10 datasets.
